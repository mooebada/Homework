/**
 * You are building the next big video sharing site that will rival YouTube.
 * It is time to build the search functionality, which means we need a function that gets a list of videos and the search string and then returns the videos based on that search string.
 *
 * The backend developer has said that the videos given will have the following structure:
 * {
 *   id: string,
 *   title: string,
 *   tags: Array of strings
 * }
 *
 * A video should be included in the list if the search string:
 * - is in the title somewhere
 * - OR is in ANY of the tags
 *
 * The search should be case insensitive and can be anywhere in the word as well! 
 * So the search string `program` should match a video with a title that includes `Programming`. 
 * And the search string `gram` should also match the video with the title that includes `Programming`
